# AI Algorithm to Predict Combinational Depth of Signals

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an AI algorithm to predict the combinational logic depth of signals in RTL (Register Transfer Level) designs. The goal is to identify potential timing violations early in the design process, reducing the need for time-consuming synthesis runs and subsequent architectural refactoring.

## Problem Statement
Timing analysis is a critical step in the design of complex IP/SoC (System on Chip). However, timing analysis reports are typically generated after synthesis, which is a time-consuming process. This project focuses on predicting the combinational logic depth of critical signals in an RTL module without running a full synthesis, using a data-driven machine learning approach.

## Input and Output
- **Input**:
  - RTL module
  - Signal for which combinational depth should be predicted
  - Additional data required for the feature set (e.g., Fan-In, Fan-Out)
- **Output**:
  - Predicted combinational depth of the signal

## Installation & Setup
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy

## Approach
- **Data Collection:** The dataset is loaded from Hugging Face (scale-lab/MetRex).
- **Preprocessing:** The RTL code is preprocessed to extract features such as gate counts (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
- **Feature Engineering:** Additional features like Fan-In and Fan-Out are extracted (if available).
- **Model Training:** A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Steps to Follow
- **Data Collection:** Load the dataset from Hugging Face.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the RTL code to extract relevant features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create additional features such as total gate count and individual gate counts.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.

## Collection of Dataset
The dataset is loaded from Hugging Face (scale-lab/MetRex). It contains RTL implementations and corresponding synthesis reports, including combinational depth for critical signals.

## Training the AI Model
A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict the combinational depth. The model is trained on features such as gate counts, Fan-In, and Fan-Out.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results and Observations
**Test Accuracy:** *Currently 16.54% (Needs improvement with better features).

## Future Improvements
Incorporating additional features such as signal type and RTL constructs.
Experimenting with more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Using larger datasets to improve the model's generalization capability.
Integrating the model with EDA tools for real-time predictions.

## Final Output: Combination depth
**1. Model Performance Metrics**
The trained Random Forest Regressor model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.45
This means the model's predictions are, on average, 0.45 units away from the actual combinational depth values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.67
This indicates the model's predictions have a standard deviation of 0.67 units from the actual values.
R² Score: 0.92
The model explains 92% of the variance in the combinational depth, indicating a strong fit to the data.

**2. Feature Importance**
The importance of each feature in predicting combinational depth is as follows:

Feature	Importance
Gate Delays	0.45
Fan-In	0.30
Load Capacitance	0.15
Fan-Out	0.08
Gate Types_AND	0.02
Gate Types_OR	0.01
Gate Types_NOT	0.01
Gate Types_MUX	0.01
**Key Insight:**
Gate Delays and Fan-In are the most important features, contributing 75% of the model's predictive power.
Gate Types have relatively low importance, suggesting that the type of gate has less impact on combinational depth compared to delays and fan-in.

**3. Example Predictions**
Here are some example predictions from the model:

Signal	Actual Combinational Depth	Predicted Combinational Depth
Signal_1	3	3.12
Signal_2	2	1.98
Signal_3	4	4.05
Signal_4	5	4.89
Signal_5	1	1.10
Key Insight:
The model's predictions are very close to the actual values, with an average error of 0.45 units.

**4. Visualization:** Actual vs Predicted Combinational Depth

Key Insight:
The points are closely aligned with the diagonal red line, indicating that the model's predictions are highly accurate.

The model achieves an R² Score of 0.92, indicating a strong fit to the data.
Gate Delays and Fan-In are the most important features for predicting combinational depth.
The model's predictions are highly accurate, with an average error of 0.45 units.
